            <h1> Welcome! <br> I'm Christian Koutsandreas </h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Christian Koutsandreas and I'm a computer science and statistics major in my final year of study. I have a strong passion for coding and enjoy experimenting with statistical and AI models to predict and classify the future. My analytical skills and ability to visualize and interpret data are key to my success in this area. In my spare time, I enjoy playing intermural soccer and exploring a variety of fields outside of my primary areas of study, including earth science and financial markets.</p>

            <p>I'm excited to bring my skills and experience to any field or discipline and am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. I love my craft and hope my work helps make optimal decisions.</p>
            
            <p>In my free time, I stay active and enjoy exploring new interests. I am always up for a challenge and am eager to see what the future holds.</p>
